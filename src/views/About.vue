      <p>
        This project is nothing more and nothing less than an experiment to test
        vue 3, pinia, tailwindcss and the new composition API
      </p>

      <p>
        Why did I choose the 'Kiloday' subject? Well, I was curious about the
        subject and I wanted to see how it would look like in a real world
        application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides that, I also wanted to integrate Sentry and Cypress, and this
        project serves as a good playground to test, break and get some fun üòÅ
